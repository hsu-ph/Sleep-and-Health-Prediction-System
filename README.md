# CSYE7200-Final-Project
# Sleep-and-Health-Prediction-System


This project aims to investigate the relationship between sleep conditions and health indicators, specifically body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure. By analyzing factors such as sleep duration, sleep quality, and stress levels, we apply machine learning techniques to predict health outcomes. The project utilizes two public datasets—one focused on sleep and lifestyle habits, and another on heart health parameters—to ensure robust model training and evaluation. Through systematic data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development (e.g., logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, random forest), we aim to uncover meaningful trends between behavioral sleep patterns and physical health metrics.

To enhance user engagement and practical application, we developed an interactive web interface using Scala and the Play Framework, integrated with MongoDB for remote data access. This interface allows users to input their personal sleep data and receive instant health predictions based on the trained models. The goal is to offer individuals a personalized, data-driven insight into how their sleep habits may influence their health, supported by a prediction accuracy and F1-score target of at least 70%. The full project, including all data pipelines and source code, is available on GitHub.
